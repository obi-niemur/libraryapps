This Library app allows students to reserve books and librarians to add and delete books. It also implements session management to control login and logout activity.

The app was developed using the following technologies:

JSP: The backend framework for the app. SQL Server: The database used to store the app's data. CSS: The stylesheet language used to style the app's UI. HTML: The markup language used to define the structure of the app's pages. The app was developed using a modular approach, which made it easy to maintain and extend.
